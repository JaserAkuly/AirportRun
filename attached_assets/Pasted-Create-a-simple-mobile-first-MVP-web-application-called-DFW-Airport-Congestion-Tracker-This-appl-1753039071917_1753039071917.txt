Create a simple, mobile-first MVP web application called "DFW Airport Congestion Tracker." This application should display real-time congestion and predictive insights specifically for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), targeting frequent flyers.

Key MVP Features to Include:

Real-Time TSA Wait Times:

Display current TSA security checkpoint wait times for each terminal (A, B, C, D, E).

Clearly indicate wait times using color-coded visuals: green (short wait: under 10 min), yellow (moderate: 10-20 min), and red (long: over 20 min).

Real-Time Flight Delay and Status:

Show live flight delays and departure status specifically for DFW departures, refreshed at least every 5 minutes.

Categorize delays visually as minimal, moderate, or severe.

Real-Time Parking Availability:

Display current parking availability status for each terminal's primary parking garage at DFW.

Indicate availability clearly: open (green), almost full (yellow), full (red).

Predictive Congestion Indicator:

Provide a simple predictive model showing upcoming peak congestion hours at the airport (for the next 12 hours), helping users plan their departure effectively.

Visual indicators for congestion level (Low, Medium, High).

Critical Integrations & Data:

TSA Wait Time Data: Integrate using the MyTSA API.

Flight Delay/Status Data: Integrate using FlightAware AeroAPI or AviationStack API.

Parking Data: Integrate by scraping live data from the official DFW Airport parking website (using Apify or ScrapingBee).

Technical Setup Recommendations:

Use Supabase for database and authentication to securely store user preferences (favorite terminals, flights).

Utilize Lovable.ai (or a similar low-code platform) to quickly design a clean, user-friendly, and responsive dashboard UI.

Ensure data integrations via no-code connectors or API middleware like Make.com, Zapier, or direct API connections provided by Lovable.ai.

Optimize for quick load time and automatic data refresh every 5 minutes.

Deliverables:

A single-page, responsive dashboard view.

Clear visual categorization of real-time and predictive data.

Minimal but essential interactivity for personalization (e.g., select a default terminal or preferred flights).

Prioritize simplicity, reliability, and clarity, ensuring users can easily understand airport congestion status at a glance.
